- Go over each datetime object for columns in lpp
- Find index of same datetime object in columns in arso
- store index of datetime in arso in column vector

- use column vector of indices to build matrix from rows
in arso matrix corresponding to the indices in the indices vector.

- join the two matrices together using numpy.hstack
